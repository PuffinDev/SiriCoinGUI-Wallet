# SiriCoinGUI-Wallet
This wallet is specially made for desktop purposes (its not web based) and this saves your wallet address in a text file and utilises it every time you open the wallet that means it doesnt login using metamask or it doesnt connect to metamask every time you open the wallet. And the gui isnt that impressing as i had no time to make it ill be working on it once my exam finishes..

# How to Setup (Usage)
As refrence to the above you will have to setup the datafile first in order to do that First Run the installer.exe and install the wallet in a specific folder(Just create a new folder in C:\\Downloads) downloads folder of your windows after that please run ``SiriCoinWalletsetup.exe or SiriCoinWalletsetup.py`` file in order to save the data file and then once it is finished you can run ``SiriCoinWalletmain.exe or SiriCoinWalletmain.py`` which is the main wallet (IT DOESNT RUN WITHOUT DATAFILE SO PLEASE RUN SETUP FIRST AND THEN THE WALLET) Thanks
